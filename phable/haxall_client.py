    [Haxall](https://haxall.io/) application. May help prevent accidentially leaving a

    `open_haxall_client` can be directly imported as follows:

    ```python
    from phable import open_haxall_client

    **Example:**

    ```python

    [close op](https://project-haystack.org/doc/docHaystack/Ops#close), which was
    later introduced. Therefore the context manager may not work with earlier versions
    of Haxall.

    Parameters:
        uri: URI of endpoint such as "http://host/api/myProj/".
        username: Username for the API user.
        password: Password for the API user.
        content_type:
            Format of data exchanged via HTTP. "json" and "zinc" options are supported.
        ssl_context:
            Optional SSL context. If not provided, a SSL context with default
            settings is created and used.
